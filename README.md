# BridgeConnect - Microblogging Social Network 🌐📱

This project aims to develop a microblogging social network inspired by platforms like Twitter or Mastodon, incorporating specific features that encourage mindful usage.

## Primary Objective 🎯

The main goal of this project is to enable anyone to sign up on the platform and publish posts. A distinctive feature includes:

### Tag Selection 🔖

Every user will have to choose a tag from a list of 10 predefined tags at the time of publishing a post. Each tag will be associated with a specific color to ease visualization and content categorization.

### Wireframes & Mockups 🖼️

Development of wireframes and mockups for desktop and mobile versions will be created using the Figma tool. These visual mockups will encompass the design of the homepage and user profile.
